## PART 1: Interactive Shell Warm-up (5 exercises)

Practice these in the Python interactive shell (>>>):

**Exercise 1.1:** Calculate the following and verify your answers:
```
2 ** 8
17 % 5
100 // 3
(5 + 3) * 2
5 + 3 * 2
```

**Exercise 1.2:** Try these string operations:
```
'Python' + 'Rocks'
'Ha' * 10
len('Information Systems')
```

**Exercise 1.3:** Test these type conversions:
```
str(100)
int('500')
float('3.14159')
int(9.99)
```

**Exercise 1.4:** Find the data type of these values:
```
type(42)
type(42.0)
type('42')
type(len('test'))
```

**Exercise 1.5:** Predict what these will return, then test:
```
round(16.7)
round(2.5)
abs(-42)
abs(42)
```

## PART 2: Variable Practice (5 exercises)

**Exercise 2.1:** Create variables and perform calculations
- Create a variable `age` and assign your age to it
- Create a variable `next_year_age` that equals `age + 1`
- Print both values

**Exercise 2.2:** String variable practice
- Create a variable `first_name` with your first name
- Create a variable `last_name` with your last name
- Create a variable `full_name` that combines them with a space
- Print `full_name`
- Print the length of `full_name`

**Exercise 2.3:** Overwriting variables
- Create a variable `counter` = 0
- Add 5 to `counter` (reassign it)
- Multiply `counter` by 2 (reassign it)
- Print the final value of `counter`

**Exercise 2.4:** Math with variables
- Create `price` = 19.99
- Create `quantity` = 3
- Calculate `total` = price * quantity
- Print the result

**Exercise 2.5:** Variable naming practice
Which of these are VALID variable names? (Don't run them, just identify)
```
user_age
UserAge
2fast
my-name
total_sum
_private
class
hello world
TOTAL
```

## PART 3: User Input Programs (5 exercises)

Create separate .py files for these programs.

**Exercise 3.1:** Simple Greeting
Write a program that:
- Asks for the user's name
- Prints "Hello, [name]!"

**Exercise 3.2:** Age Calculator
Write a program that:
- Asks for the user's current age
- Calculates and prints their age next year
- Calculates and prints their age 10 years from now

**Exercise 3.3:** Rectangle Area Calculator
Write a program that:
- Asks for the length of a rectangle
- Asks for the width of a rectangle
- Calculates area (length * width)
- Prints "The area is: [result]"

**Exercise 3.4:** Temperature Converter
Write a program that:
- Asks for temperature in Celsius
- Converts to Fahrenheit using: F = C * 9/5 + 32
- Prints the result

**Exercise 3.5:** Name Length
Write a program that:
- Asks for the user's full name
- Prints the number of characters in their name
- Prints the name repeated 3 times

## PART 4: Expression Challenges (5 exercises)

Solve these using Python expressions:

**Exercise 4.1:** Calculate your age in days
- Assume a year has 365 days
- Use your age and multiply by 365
- Store in a variable and print

**Exercise 4.2:** String repetition pattern
- Create a pattern using '*' repeated 20 times
- Print it 5 times (5 lines of 20 stars each)

**Exercise 4.3:** Money calculation
- You have $100
- Each item costs $7
- How many items can you buy? (use //)
- How much money is left over? (use %)
- Print both answers

**Exercise 4.4:** Average calculator
Write a program that:
- Takes three test scores as input
- Calculates the average
- Prints the average rounded to 1 decimal place

**Exercise 4.5:** Circle calculations
Write a program that:
- Asks for the radius of a circle
- Calculates circumference: 2 * 3.14159 * radius
- Calculates area: 3.14159 * radius ** 2
- Prints both results

## PART 5: Debugging Exercises (5 exercises)

Each of these has an ERROR. Identify and fix the bug:

**Exercise 5.1:**
```python
print('Your age is: ' + 25)
```

**Exercise 5.2:**
```python
age = input('Enter age: ')
next_year = age + 1
print(next_year)
```

**Exercise 5.3:**
```python
name = Alice
print(name)
```

**Exercise 5.4:**
```python
result = 'Number' * 2.5
print(result)
```

**Exercise 5.5:**
```python
user_input = input('Enter a number: ')
doubled = user_input * 2
print(doubled)
```
(Hint: What happens if user enters '5'? Is that what you want?)

## PART 6: Challenge Programs (3 harder exercises)

**Exercise 6.1:** Trip Cost Calculator
Write a program that:
- Asks for miles to drive
- Asks for miles per gallon (MPG) of the car
- Asks for price per gallon of gas
- Calculates total cost: (miles / MPG) * price_per_gallon
- Prints the total cost

**Exercise 6.2:** Mad Libs
Write a program that:
- Asks for a noun
- Asks for a verb
- Asks for an adjective
- Asks for a place
- Creates a funny sentence using all inputs
- Example: "The [adjective] [noun] decided to [verb] at the [place]!"

**Exercise 6.3:** Receipt Generator

- Asks for item name
- Asks for item price
- Asks for quantity
- Calculates subtotal
- Calculates 8% tax
- Calculates total (subtotal + tax)
- Prints a formatted receipt with all values

## BONUS: Type Conversion Practice

**Exercise B.1:** Predict the output, then test:
```python
str(3) + str(4)
int('3') + int('4')
'3' + '4'
3 + 4
```

**Exercise B.2:** What happens when you run these? (Try to predict first!)
```python
int('hello')
int('3.5')
float('3.5')
str(3.5)
```

## ANSWER KEY NOTES

- Try solving these yourself first
- Test in the interactive shell or create .py files
- If you get errors, read them carefully - they tell you what's wrong
- Compare your solutions with classmates or ask for help

**Remember:** The goal is to PRACTICE, not to be perfect. Making mistakes
and fixing them is how you learn programming!
