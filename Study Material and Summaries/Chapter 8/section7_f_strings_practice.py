# SECTION 7: F-STRINGS - Practice

# Q1: Create variables 'city' with value 'Boston' and 'temp' with value 72, then print: The temperature in Boston is 72 degrees.
# Example: place = 'Paris'
# Example: degrees = 20
# Example: print(f'The temperature in {place} is {degrees} degrees.')
place ='Boston'
temp = 72
print (f'the temp in {place} is {temp} degrees')


# Q2: Create variables 'length' with value 8 and 'width' with value 6, then print: The area is 48
# Example: x = 5
# Example: y = 4
# Example: print(f'The area is {x * y}')
length = 8
width = 6
print(f'the area is {length * width}')


# Q3: Create variables 'product' with value 'Laptop' and 'cost' with value 999, then print: The Laptop costs $999
# Example: item = 'Phone'
# Example: price = 500
# Example: print(f'The {item} costs ${price}')
product = 'laptop'
costs = 999
print(f'The {product } cost {costs}.')


# Q4: Create variable 'current_year' with value 2026 and 'birth_year' with value 2000, then print: You are 26 years old
# Example: now = 2026
# Example: born = 1995
# Example: print(f'You are {now - born} years old')
currentYear = 2026
birthYear = 2000
print(f'you are {currentYear - birthYear} years old.')
