# What We Need to Build - Simple List

## The Tasks (In Order)

1. **Import the CSV file**
   - Open the construction data file
   - Load it into PowerShell so we can work with it

2. **Filter the data**
   - Pick out only the records we care about
   - Like filtering in Excel - show me only Open items, or only Overdue items

3. **Count things**
   - How many total forms?
   - How many are overdue?
   - How many open actions are there?

4. **Calculate the completion percentage**
   - Figure out what percent of work is done
   - Basic math: (finished / total) × 100

5. **Group items by category**
   - How many Open vs Closed vs In Progress?
   - Which projects have the most forms?

6. **Create an HTML table**
   - Make a simple table that shows the data
   - Like converting to a webpage

7. **Add styling to make it look nice**
   - Colors, borders, formatting
   - So it looks professional, not ugly

8. **Build the complete report**
   - Put all the pieces together
   - Header, summary, tables, etc.

9. **Save the report to a file**
   - Write the HTML to a file on the computer
   - So we can open it and see what it looks like

10. **Set up email**
    - Configure email settings
    - Username, password, server info

11. **Send the report by email**
    - Email the HTML report to someone
    - Like sending an attachment, but the report IS the email body

12. **Put it all in one script**
    - Make it so you can run one command and it does everything
    - Import → Filter → Calculate → Create HTML → Send Email
