## PowerShell vs Python Talking Points

**Similarities:**
- Both scripting languages
- Variables, loops, conditionals
- Object-oriented
- Great for automation

**Differences:**
- PowerShell: Windows-native, cmdlet-based, pipeline-focused
- Python: Cross-platform, library-based, general-purpose
- Syntax differences ($ for variables, Verb-Noun cmdlets)
- PowerShell excels at Windows admin tasks
- Python has broader application domains

**When to Use Each:**
- PowerShell: Windows automation, Active Directory, Exchange, system administration
- Python: Data science, web development, cross-platform scripts, AI/ML
